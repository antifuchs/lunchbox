== Lunchbox ==

Lunchbox is a real-time file push mechanism.  It allows one to transparently and
securely manage a directory on a remote server.  This project is by no means an
original idea (see Dropbox, inotifyfs, and sshfs for starters), but I do find it
useful as a very lightweight and secure sync mechanism.

== Usage ==

Just run
  bin/lunchbox sshspec:remotedir [localdir]

For example,
  bin/lunchbox gdb@example.com:/home/gdb/my-project my-project

Would synchronize local changes to my-project to the remote my-project
directory.

== Note ==

The current implementation was a proof-of-concept barebones implementation.  If
I or someone else finds actual use-case for this system, I'd be happy to work on
it more seriously.
